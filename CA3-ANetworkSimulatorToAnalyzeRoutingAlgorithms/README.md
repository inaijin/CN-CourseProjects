# **Network Simulator to Analyze Routing Algorithms**

## **Introduction**

Welcome to our **Network Simulator to Analyze Routing Algorithms** project! This project aims to build a network simulation environment that mimics real-world network behavior. The simulator is designed to study and analyze various routing algorithms, including RIP and OSPF, under different network conditions and topologies.

The core of our simulation is built using **C++ with the Qt Framework**, utilizing modular, object-oriented programming principles. This ensures scalability, maintainability, and efficient handling of components such as routers, PCs, and Autonomous Systems (AS). The simulator supports dynamic configurations via JSON files, enabling the creation of custom topologies and simulation parameters.
