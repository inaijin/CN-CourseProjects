# **Network Simulator to Analyze Routing Algorithms**

## **Introduction**

Welcome to our **Network Simulator to Analyze Routing Algorithms** project! This project aims to build a network simulation environment that mimics real-world network behavior. The simulator is designed to study and analyze various routing algorithms, including RIP and OSPF, under different network conditions and topologies.

The core of our simulation is built using **C++ with the Qt Framework**, utilizing modular, object-oriented programming principles. This ensures scalability, maintainability, and efficient handling of components such as routers, PCs, and Autonomous Systems (AS). The simulator supports dynamic configurations via JSON files, enabling the creation of custom topologies and simulation parameters.

## **Phases of the Project**

Our project is divided into multiple phases, each focusing on a specific aspect of the simulation:

1. **Phase 1 (Point Zero Phase)**: 
   - Initialize the network by constructing the topology based on the configuration file.
   - Set up components such as PCs, routers, ports, and Autonomous Systems (AS).
   - Ensure all nodes are connected but remain inactive.

2. **Phase 2 (Component Implementation)**:
   - Implement foundational classes necessary for the network to function, including:
     - **IP**
     - **IPHeader**
     - **Port**
     - **PortBindingManager**
     - **Node**
     - **PC**
     - **Router** (without routing algorithms)
     - **TopologyBuilder**
     - **TopologyController**
     - **AutonomousSystem**
   - By the end of this phase, the topology should be fully constructed and operational, capable of simulating packet exchanges.
   - Some DHCP functionality may also be included to enable dynamic IP assignment.

3. **Phase 3 (Execution Phase)**:
   - Simulate network traffic by generating and transmitting data packets.
   - Implement and test routing algorithms such as RIP and OSPF.
   - Observe the behavior of these algorithms under various conditions, including link failures and congestion.

4. **Phase 4 (Analysis and Reporting)**:
   - Analyze the simulation results, including metrics like packet loss, hop count, and waiting cycles.
   - Compare the performance of routing algorithms and generate comprehensive reports.
